xmpp2serial
===========

Control serial devices via XMPP from anywhere on ~~Earth~~ the Internet!

There are two parts:

###Java XMPP client
This receives XMPP messages from a trusted address and translates them in to the appropriate commands for the serial hardware. Then it sends the commands to the hardware via the C application.

The XMPP client, serial control and logging is configured in the xmpp.properties file.

###C serial driver
This opens the selected serial port and sends the serial commands generated by the Java application to the serial hardware. It returns any output from the serial hardware, closes the port and exits.
